# Swingstar

Swingstar is a simple, fast paced 2d arcade game. The objective of the game is to use a rope-swinging mechanic to progress as far through the cave as possible. Swinging faster will increase your point multiplier.

- Programming, Game Design and Sound: Nic Barker
- Music: Joe Pfeffer
- Art: ??? (It was done by a contracter a long time ago, who's name I can no longer find ðŸ˜–)

### Build
Swingstar is built in (what I assume to be) standard Unity style. The game is split across 4 scenes - the intro, the main menu, the tutorial screen and the main game. I didn't see any point adding functionality to return to the main menu after you've started the game, as everything in the main menu is still accessible from the "Game Over" screen.
